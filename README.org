#+TITLE: Orion: Shadow
#+AUTHOR: Jakob Klemm

Distributed routing & messaging protocol for the =Engine: Orion=
system using =Elixir= and =TCP-Sockets=.

* Getting started
How to setup nodes & a cluster:
- Start the =hunter= router on each node.
- Populate the config, both for =hunter=, as well as for =shadow=.
- Start =shadow= on all nodes.
- Generate a =member.json= file on one of the nodes.
- Move that file to the other node & import it.
- (This program requires other components in =Engine: Orion= to work
  properly & process useful data).
* Architecture
- Each node is both a server & a router.
- Each node has a key (0..2^160).
- Nodes are connected with direct TCP connections.
* Structure
- Routing:
  - Overview of all connected nodes.
  - Supervises connections & "member-processes".
  - Decides Routing targets.
- Member:
  - Holds the active :gen_tcp connections.
  - Listens for incoming tcp-packets.
  - Two types: :in / :out, :gen_tcp.connect / :gen_tcp.listen.
