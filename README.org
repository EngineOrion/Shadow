#+TITLE: Orion: Shadow
#+AUTHOR: Jakob Klemm

Distributed routing & messaging protocol for the =Engine: Orion= system.

* Architecture
- Each node is both a server & a router.
- Each node has a Key (0..2^160). (Randomly generated)
- Nodes are connected with direct TCP connections.
* Structure
- Routing:
  - Overview of all connected nodes.
  - Supervises connections & "member-processes".
  - Decides Routing targets.
- Member:
  - Holds the active :gen_tcp connections.
  - Listens for incoming tcp-packets.
  - Two types: :in / :out, :gen_tcp.connect / :gen_tcp.listen.
* TODOs
** TODO Unit Testing & Type safety
** TODO Unix socket communication
** TODO Test with multiple instances
** TODO Missing container loop issue.
